        <p>Submissions will be accepted between {{ .Site.Params.callforpapers.dates }}. </p>
        <p>We are looking for <b>15 minute talks</b> (give or take a minute) on topics relevant to the R community, followed by moderated Q&A for about 5 minutes. As we go virtual this year, we are seeking snappy and eclectic content; itâ€™s okay if your talk errs on the shorter side. It is also fine if you want to touch on a few different, but related, topics (e.g. three related functions from the same package), or if you wish to reuse prior material (e.g. blog post, package vignette, etc.).</p>
        <p>We are also accepting applications for moderators to host informal <b>30 minute virtual meet-ups</b> on special topics within the R community in order to bring a social element into our event. If you are passionate about a specific topic (e.g. causal inference, spatial data, etc.) and want to hold a breakout, please use the application form to share a few example discussion questions.</p>
