abstractTitle: 'Stories from LightGBM's Journey to CRAN'
abstract: 'If you've ever been mystified by the stream of compiler messages that show up when you run install.packages(), this talk might be for you! This talk will highlight some sad, strange, and beautiful features of the R ecosystem that I've learned in the two years I've been working on getting LightGBM's R package ready for CRAN. LightGBM is a machine learning library implemented in C++. The C++ library is shared by wrappers in several languages, including Java, Python, and R, and the talk will the unique challenges that poses. Think of this talk as a short, dramatic interpretation of "Writing R Extensions" (https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html).'
